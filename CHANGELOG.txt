Added support for ORGANIZE BY statement

2. Added support for PostgreSQL INHERITS statement. Issue: https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/191

**v0.29.1**
### Important updates:
1. Python 3.6 is deprecated in tests and by default, try to move to Python3.7, but better to 3.8, because 3.7 will be deprecated in 2023.

### Fixes
1. Fix for https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/177

### Imporvements
1. Added support for Oracle 2 component size for types, like '30 CHAR'. From https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/176


**v0.29.0**

### Fixes
1.  AUTOINCREMENT statement now parsed validly same way as AUTO_INCREMENT and showed up in output as 'autoincrement' property of the column
Fix for: https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/170
2. Fix issue ' TypeError argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable' on some foreigen keys https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/148 

### New Features

1. Support for non-numeric column type parameters https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/171 
It shows in column attribute 'type_parameters'.


**v0.28.1**
Imporvements:
1. Lines started with INSERT INTO statement now successfully ignored by parser (so you can keep them in ddl - they will be just skiped)

Fixes:
1. Important fix for multiline comments


**v0.28.0**

Important Changes (Pay attention):
1. Because of parsing now AUTO_INCREMENT as a separate property of column previous output changed. 
Previously it was parsed as a part of type like:  'INT AUTO_INCREMENT'. 
Now type will be only 'INT', but in column property you will see 'autoincrement': True.

Amazing innovation:
1. It's is weird to write in Changelog, but only in version 0.28.0 I recognize that floats that not supported by parser & it was fixed.
Thanks for the sample in the issue: https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/163

Improvements:
MariaDB:
1. Added support for MariaDB AUTO_INCREMENT (from ddl here - https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/144)
If column is Auto Incremented - it indicated as 'autoincrement': True in column defenition

Common:
1. Added parsing for multiline comments in DDL with `/* */` syntax.
2. Comments from DDL now all placed in 'comments' keyword if you use `group_by_type=` arg in parser.
3. Added argument 'parser_settings={}' (dict type) in method  parse_from_file() - this way you can pass any arguments that you want to DDLParser (& that supported by it)
So, if you want to set log_level=logging.WARNING for parser - just use it as:
parse_from_file('path_to_file', parser_settings={'log_level': logging.WARNING}). For issue: https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/160

**v0.27.0**

1. Added support for ORACLE 'ORGANIZATION INDEX' 
2. Added support for SparkSQL Partition by with procedure call - https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/154

**v0.25.0**
## Fixes:

1. Fix for issue with 'at time zone' https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/112

## New features:

1. Added flag to raise errors if parser cannot parse statement DDLParser(.., silent=False) - https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/109
2. Added flag to DDLParser(.., normalize_names=True) that change output of parser:
if flag is True (default 'False') then all identifiers will be returned without '[', '"' and other delimeters that used in different SQL dialects to separate custom names from reserverd words & statements.
For example, if flag set 'True' and you pass this input: 

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[TO_Requests](
    [Request_ID] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    [user_id] [int]

In output you will have names like 'dbo' and 'TO_Requests', not '[dbo]' and '[TO_Requests]'.
